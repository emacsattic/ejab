                      A Jabber Client for Emacs

OVERVIEW

  Jabber is an open source, extensible, modularized, cross platform,
  instant messaging system.

  Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
  display editor.

  With EJab, you get the best of both worlds.  A Jabber client written
  entirely in Emacs Lisp, EJab allows you to use your favorite emacs
  text editing commands to send instant messages to friends on any
  other IM system that Jabber can connect to.  In addition, EJab is
  fully customizable, with a hook-based architecture that makes it
  easy to write add-on modules.

FEATURES

  * Send and receive messages with other Jabber users
  * Control online presence status (Away, DND, etc.)
  * View roster with online status in a hierarchical group format

  * Supports the jabber:x:envelope extensions (CC, ReplyTo, etc.)
  * Supports nested roster groups with the `group/subgroup' format
  * Compatible with SuperCite for citing replies
  * Compatible with MailCrypt for signed/encrypted messages

NON-FEATURES

  All these missing features are planned to become a part of EJab in
  future releases.

  * Digest authentication not supported (uses plain text)
  * Cannot register a new user on a server
  * Cannot display or register with new agents and transports

  * Does not support 1-on-1 chat messages
  * Does not support groupchat
  * Does not support OOB file transfers

  * Does not support the temporary vCard format
  * Cannot search user databases
  * Cannot send or display rich text (XHTML Basic)

INSTALLATION

  EJab doesn't yet have any fancy installation.  Just copy the elisp
  files to a directory in your emacs `load-path', and add the
  following line to your emacs initialization file:

    (require 'ejab)

  This loads all the core EJab modules.  Any additional modules you
  wish to use may have to be loaded separately.  (As of version 0.1.0,
  there are no additional modules yet.)

CONFIGURATION

  EJab needs to know is your Jabber server, username, and password.
  It will normally prompt you for these when connecting, but if you
  prefer not to be asked, you can set any or all of them in your
  initialization file, as follows:

    (setq ejab-default-server "jabber.org"
          ejab-default-username "johndoe"
          ejab-default-password "password")

  You may wish to select a display style in your initialization file:

    (ejab-use-style "popup")

  As of 0.1.0, the available styles are "standard" (the default) and
  "popup" (more like other graphical IM clients).

USAGE

  By default, EJab installs a global menu in the menu bar, and a
  global keymap under `C-c !'.  (You can turn these off by setting
  `ejab-display-global-menu' and/or `ejab-global-map-prefix' before
  loading EJab.)  Most of the functions should be self-explanatory.

  As of version 0.1.0, EJab has no manual or tutorial describing usage
  or customization (a more complicated subject).  The documentation
  strings of functions and variables are pretty good, though.  Anyone
  willing to do some documentation work is welcome.

MORE INFO

  Further information, along with the most recent version of EJab, is
  available from the EJab home page, <http://ejab.sourceforge.net>.
  In addition, EJab has three mailing lists:

  * ejab-announce, for announcements of new releases
  * ejab-users, for discussion of usage and configuration
  * ejab-devel, for those developing the client

  You can subscribe to any or all of these from the EJab project page
  on SourceForge, which is accessible from the EJab home page.
