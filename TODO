                         TO DO LIST FOR EJAB
                         ===================

* Test clickable users in roster display
* "Read Next" queuing by user
* Hide groups with no online users in them?
* Digest authentication.
* registering new users
* 1on1 chat messages
* groupchat
* agents/transports.
* mod_filter
* Implement more iq and x namespaces (searching, etc.)
* Rich text (XHTML Basic)

Parsing routines are slow with large text like a reasonably sized
roster list.  Save state when text is incomplete?

Make subelements namespace-dependent?  How?
